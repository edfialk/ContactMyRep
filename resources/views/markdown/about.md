ContactMyReps.org is a comprehensive government tracking website aimed at providing every possible contact channel, including social media, for U.S. representatives in the highest levels of government. The site is used by ordinary citizens and it  provides them a tool to become engaged in the democratic process and to hold elected official accountable.

We created a sophisticated search engine that accurately identifies all of your elected representatives based on your zip code alone. You can also search by using your location, by state or even by a representativeâ€™s name. We bring together all of their official communication methods along with their social media accounts so that you can use your preferred method of communication.

### Who We Are
ContactMyReps.org was created by a small team of activists who were tired of the high levels of corruption that has engulfed our politics. This inspired us to conceptualize, fund and create a tool that provides ordinary citizens a direct voice to their elected officials so that they can become more accountable for their actions. The technology that we have today allows us to produce a better form of government by keeping us connected.

### Join Our Movement
The open government movement involves citizens, web developers, designers, researchers, writers, statisticians, government managers, and elected officials in a concerted effort to make data a national asset, to make government more transparent and effective, and to empower citizens to participate effectively in governance and in their communities.

We are always looking for volunteers that can help us maintain, expand and market our brand. If you are an expert at social media, please drop us a line to enhance our social media accounts. If you cannot volunteer, help us by donating to our cause if you believe this to be an important tool for responsive government.

### Why Donate?
All funds received will be used strictly for website maintenance, fees and marketing campaigns. If you believe ContactMyreps.org is an important tool and more citizens should know about it, then donate to us and we will use social media to reach thousands of more equal-minded people like you.
